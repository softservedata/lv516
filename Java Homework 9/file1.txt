For many people,
career means the part of life that is concerned with employment.
From an occupational standpoint, it means the sum total of the
various jobs you may hold during your lifetime. However, these definitions
do not fully capture the meaning of career. We would like you to think of career
in a broader, more life-encompassing way. Think of the decisions you make about a
job or a college major as valuable components of a lifelong process. When viewed in this
manner, career can be defined as the sum total of decisions that direct your educational,
social, economic, political, and spiritual endeavors and reflect your unique personality
characteristics and basic life values.
